#  Dynamic Diffuse Voxel Global Illumination
An experimental implementation (C++/Vulkan) of a real-time GI technique based on the [Scalable Real-Time Global Illumination for Large Scenes](https://enlisted.net/en/news/show/25-gdc-talk-scalable-real-time-ray-traced-global-illumination-for-large-scenes-en) talk by Anton Yudintsev.

# Controls
- Right click + mouse rotates the camera.
- WASD moves the camera

# How does it work?
The indirect diffuse lighting is sampled from an irradiance volume, a grid of irradiance probes. The probes are slowly updated every frame by shooting rays into a voxel representation of the scene.
This voxel scene is initially generated by voxelizing all static geometry. Every frame lit pixels from the main camera framebuffer are then fed back into the voxel scene to keep the lighting information up to date (screen space voxelization).

# How to build
The project comes as a Visual Studio 2019 solution and already includes all dependencies. The Application should be build as x64.
