![Volumetric Lighting](featured.png?raw=true "Volumetric lighting with volumetric shadows in the Amazon Lumberyard Bistro scene")

This is the source code of my masters thesis "Real-Time Volumetric Lighting with Volumetric Shadows". The thesis details the implementation of the popular Volumetric Fog technique for volumetric lighting and expands it with a unified solution for volumetric shadows for both volumes and billboards. Additionally, the checkerboard rendering technique is used reduce the cost of the effect. Written in C++ and Vulkan 1.2.
